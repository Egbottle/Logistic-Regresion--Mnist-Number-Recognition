# Logistic-Regresion--Mnist-Number-Recognition
Using TensorFlow recognizes the Mnist Dataset
1. Load the data through tensorflow.keras(the train set and the test set have already processed).
2. Normalization and one-hot encoding
3. Choose an algorithm OVO(one versus one) or OVR(one versus rest) (Learn the detail from https://blog.csdn.net/qq_44350242/article/details/112372860)
4. OVR needs 10 logisitc regressions to binary classification(0-9)
5. Train and test
